# New Minimalism and its Algebraic Formalizations

One of the largest barriers of entry to new models of syntax is the mathematics literacy required to understand them. To promote the development of mathematics literacy in linguistics education, this course compares two mathematical approaches to syntax (Hopf-Algebraic Minimalism and Computational Minimalism), exploring their motivations and mechanics. 

We first explore what a mathematical model is, then we explore mathematical models in linguistics. After a brief detour in Chomsky's new formulations of minimalism, we critically and systematically compare Marcolli, Chomsky, and Berwick's *Mathematical Structure of Syntactic Merge* to Edward Stabler's *Computational Minimalism*.
